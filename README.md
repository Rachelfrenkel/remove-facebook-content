## Backstory of this extension

This chrome extension was created to stop my addiction to Facebook.
It is hard to get rid of Facebook due to the use of Marketplace and various groups, but I needed a way to force myself to not doom-scroll. This extension removes all content on the homepage, so that facebook can really only be visited for Marketplace and specific people/group pages.
I originally only removed the videos from the homepage, and I have left that option commented-out. I hope that this extension helps people who do not want to be wasting their time on Facebook but need that little extra bit of help.

Your Facebook homepage will still show the sidebars and birthdays on the homepage, but the main content will look like this:
